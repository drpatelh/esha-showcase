Seqera Platform is an intuitive centralized command post designed to make scientific analysis accessible at any scale. 

The Platform acts as a pane of glass, enabling users to effortlessly launch, manage, monitor, and collaborate on scalable Nextflow data analysis using their own computing resources and infrastructure.

Researchers can focus on the science that matters rather than worrying about infrastructure engineering. Seqera helps organizations:

- Launch, manage, and monitor portable Nextflow pipelines from anywhere in real-time
- Enable non-technical users to run pipelines via the intuitive Launchpad interface
- Easily provision and leverage cloud-based compute environments
- Collaborate and share pipelines and data securely among local and remote teams
- Easily access libraries of production-proven Nextflow community pipelines
- Automate complex tasks as part of broader enterprise processes

### Deployment Methods
The Platform offers two deployment methods:

- **Seqera Cloud**: A hosted version of the application available as a SaaS on Seqera's infrastructure.
- **Seqera Enterprise**: A lightweight, deployable version for your own infrastructure, consisting of three main architectural components: a backend container, a frontend container, and a database.

### Interface
All features and activities available through the user interface can also be accessed programmatically via the Seqera Platform API. The application frontend communicates with the backend through this API. For more information, refer to the [Automation](./automation.md) section later in the walkthrough.

This walkthrough will demonstrate the various features of Seqera Platform which makes it easier to build, launch, and manage scalable data pipelines.
