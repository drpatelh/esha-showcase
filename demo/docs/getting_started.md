### 2. Navigate into the seqeralabs/showcase Workspace

All resources in Seqera Platform live inside a Workspace, which in turn belong to an Organization. Typically, teams of colleagues or collaborators will share one or more workspaces. 

All resources in a Workspace (i.e. pipelines, compute environments, datasets) are shared by members of that workspace.

Navigate into the `seqeralabs/showcase` Workspace.

With Workspaces, you can:

- Separate organizations and workspaces help research teams segment their work.
- Teams can focus on specific activities, such as core R&D or clinical trials with PII, which need to be kept secure.
- Organization owners can create workspaces for specific areas like oncology, neuroscience, or therapeutics.
- Each workspace can have its own pipelines, compute environments, credentials, and users.
- Users within an organization can be organized into teams or groups.
- Access to shared workspaces can be selectively granted with different access levels.
